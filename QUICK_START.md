# Quick Start Guide: Using the PR Breakdown

## ⚠️ Important: About the Branches

The branches described in this guide were created in a sandboxed demonstration environment. **They do not automatically exist in your local repository.**

### How to Proceed

**Option 1: Recreate Branches Locally** (if you want to use branches)
- Follow **[HOW_TO_RECREATE_BRANCHES.md](HOW_TO_RECREATE_BRANCHES.md)** for step-by-step instructions
- This is optional - branches are mainly for demonstration

**Option 2: Use Documentation Only** (recommended)
- Use **[PR_DIFFS.md](PR_DIFFS.md)** to see all code changes
- Create branches only when ready to submit to upstream
- Follow **[SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md](SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md)** when submitting

**Option 3: Don't Create Branches**
- The documentation shows HOW to break down changes
- That's the key value - the approach, not the branches themselves

## What Has Been Created

✅ **9 branches** demonstrating the breakdown of PR #1  
✅ **7 documentation files** explaining the strategy  
✅ **All branches ready** to push to GitHub  

## Your Next Steps

### Option 1: Push All Branches to GitHub (Recommended)

This makes all branches visible in your GitHub repository:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/anyflights/anyflights

# Push all branches at once
git push origin baseline-before-pr1 \
  pr-a-fix-return-statement \
  pr-b-update-faa-url \
  pr-c-restore-year-parameter \
  pr-d-update-year-validation \
  pr-e-case-insensitive-helper \
  pr-f-use-case-insensitive-finding \
  pr-g-add-bounds-checking \
  pr-h-document-year-parameter
```

### Option 2: Push Branches One at a Time

Push only the branches you're ready to work with:

```bash
# Push the baseline for comparison
git push origin baseline-before-pr1

# Push high-priority fixes first
git push origin pr-a-fix-return-statement
git push origin pr-b-update-faa-url

# Push others as needed
git push origin pr-c-restore-year-parameter
# etc...
```

## Viewing the Branches

Once pushed, you'll see them on GitHub at:
```
https://github.com/wdillon-usda/anyflights/branches
```

## Creating Pull Requests from These Branches

### For Submission to Upstream (simonpcouch/anyflights)

Follow the instructions in **SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md** to:
1. Cherry-pick changes from each branch
2. Create new branches based on upstream/main
3. Submit as separate PRs to upstream

### For Review in Your Fork

You can create PRs within your fork to review the changes:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "New pull request"
3. Select `base: main` and `compare: pr-a-fix-return-statement` (or other branch)
4. Create the PR

## FAQs

**Q: Where are the branches now?**  
A: They exist locally in your git repository. Use `git branch` to see them.

**Q: How do I make them visible on GitHub?**  
A: Push them with `git push origin <branch-name>` (see Option 1 or 2 above).

**Q: Can I delete a branch if I don't need it?**  
A: Yes, use `git branch -D <branch-name>` to delete locally.

**Q: What if I want to modify a branch?**  
A: Checkout the branch (`git checkout <branch-name>`), make changes, commit, and push.

**Q: How do I submit these to the upstream repository?**  
A: See **SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md** for detailed instructions.

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Push all branches to GitHub
git push origin baseline-before-pr1 pr-a-fix-return-statement \
  pr-b-update-faa-url pr-c-restore-year-parameter \
  pr-d-update-year-validation pr-e-case-insensitive-helper \
  pr-f-use-case-insensitive-finding pr-g-add-bounds-checking \
  pr-h-document-year-parameter

# 2. View them on GitHub
# Go to: https://github.com/wdillon-usda/anyflights/branches

# 3. For upstream submission, follow SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md
# (Cherry-pick changes onto upstream/main base)

# 4. Submit as separate PRs to upstream repo
```
